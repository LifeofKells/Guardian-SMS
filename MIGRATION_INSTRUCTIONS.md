# Data Migration Instructions

The legacy data for "Guardian SMS" needs to be linked to the new organization structure ("AsoRock Security Services").

We have added a **Migration Tool** directly to the application's **Settings** page to resolve this safely.

## Steps to Restore Data:

1.  Open the application in your browser.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** page (via the sidebar or menu).
3.  Scroll down to the **"Initialize Data"** card.
4.  Click the purple button: **"Migrate Legacy Data"**.
5.  Confirm the dialog prompt.
6.  Wait for the logs to say **"Migration Complete"**.
7.  **Refresh the page**.

Your data (Clients, Sites, Officers, Shifts, etc.) should now be visible and correctly associated with your organization.
